# Profiling Network Communication using Approximate Pattern Matching

## Annotation
One of the viable methods of anomaly detection is baselining. In baselining the profile of normal communication needs to be created first. Then a significant divergence or actual network traffic to baseline triggers the attention of the detection engine. This project proposes to use approximate pattern matching as the new method for creating traffic baseline and detecting divergences. It amounts to first represent a network traffic in a suitable way that can be used for computing the profile and computing a similarity using approximate pattern matching algorithm.  

## Approach
Analyze and describe network traffic in a suitable way for approximate pattern matching method. The novelty is in the use of approximate pattern matching instead of statistical methods or machine learning. On the other hand, many principles may be in common.  

## Goal
To invent a system of anomaly detection for security events and attacks identification in network communication. Demonstrate and evaluate the proposed system for a reasonable big dataset and number of attacks described.
