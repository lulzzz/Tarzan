# Tarzan.Nfx.Model
The Tarzan.Nfx model follow principles of defined for Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) language, in particular the part focuses on STIX Domain Objects.
While not all STIX conpects are supported, the idea to use STIX approach is to provide a unified system for data objects representation. 

This project contains definitions of selected STIX Core and domain objects, as well as some custom objects related to network forensics and traffic analysis. 

These observable objects are stored in Ignite and persisted in Cassandra.
